;;; Commentary:

;; An implementation of cuid2 in Emacs Lisp based on:
;;   reference implementation: https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2
;;   python implementation:    https://github.com/gordon-code/cuid2
;;
;; This library is not meant for real world usage, rather to simply to
;; generate cuids while editing text. As such, the collision resistance
;; of cuids generated with this library should not be trusted.
;;
;; NOTE: The default Emacs SHA512 algorithm is used here, which is NOT
;; the latest SHA-3 version as used in the cuid2 reference implementation.
;; This library follows the logic from the Python implementation which
;; falls back to SHA-2 512 if the SHA-3 version is not available, only
;; in this case always using the SHA-2 version.
